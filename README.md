Here are my solutions to the list of exercises completed in preparation for tier 2 of the 42 exams.

All of these solutions were tested and most of them were heavily tested. However, your ultimate shield against Moulinette is the subject and a big set of tests that **YOU UNDERSTAND**

I openly accept and encourage you to open an issue if you find that one of my functions or programs does not pass a new and relevant test that you tried and can show me how to replicate the behavior.

However, if you are going to complain about the fact that some functions do not pass the tests of the grademe.fr you need to have a good argument based on the subject. I say this because some of their tests are **not reasonable at all** and I even opened some issues at their repo about their tests for fprime, do_op, and maybe some others.
