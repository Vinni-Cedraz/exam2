1-> is whitespace
2-> wordcounter
3-> test them
4-> next_valid_char
5-> next_whitespace
6-> lenstrcopy (will copy len bytes and append a '\0')
7-> my_split (will have char *start, char *end, int worcount, int index, and char**split)


my_split details:

1->to count the number of words in the string in order to allocate enough space for **split
2-> then we append a NULL pointer to the end of **split

3-> then we start the loop (++index < wordcount) 
{
  start is the pointer to the first char of the word on str (hence next_valid_char(str))
  end is the pointer to the first whitespace after it (hence next_whitespace(str))
  the length of each word is given by (end - start) (sum 1 to it and that's how we allocate space for each)
  split[index] is allocated with space for the null char
  lenstrcopy copies len chars from its second parameter to it's first , append a null byte to it and doesnt return anything
  str is set to end at the end of each iteration (a simple str = end)
}
